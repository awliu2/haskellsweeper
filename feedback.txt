Loren's Feedback:
Looks good. Good callout on the focus and difficulty of using a functional paradigm; having nice and clean code would almost certainly require a good understanding
Bhakti's Feedback:
Looks like a good plan! If you're planning on exploring GUIs, some of the good ones are gloss, monomer; if you're planning on exploring UIs in the terminal, something like brick might help

Score: 3/3
