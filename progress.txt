Current Progress:

Rough working version of minesweeper board data structure. Not quite optimized yet, but it works.

Next Steps:
- Use State to keep track of board, instead of passing it around as a prop
- Figure out how to recursively reveal squares when they have no adj. mines
- Work on implementing KeyPresses and actually playing the game
    - For now, just print the board to terminal


- Save/load game state to/from local storage
- GUI? (I.E with Gloss)? If time allows. Pretty busy with other courses as well.
